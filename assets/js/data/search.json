This is a choice we made to have a cleaner and more organized code.ConnectionFor the connection we use the standard and fastest library for TCP connection std::net, in particular TcpStream and TcpListener,this allows the file trasnfer to make a safe and fast connection.Progress barThe progress bar is based on the file size of the file, displaying the bytes and time elapsed precise.File limitThis file trasnfer has no size limit, since we split the bytes into multiple buffers gaining the best speed and the less stress on the ram." }, { "title": "Jim Split", "url": "/posts/jimsplit/", "categories": "jim", "tags": "jim, split, gym", "date": "2022-08-19 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "Here is my current jim split.
