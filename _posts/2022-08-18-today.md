Welcome to my new blog post, here i will share with you some of my coding and life experiences. 
Here is a little showcase of the code higlighting and math support.
I'll also talk about clothes, movies and music.


```console
$ env |grep SHELL
SHELL=/usr/local/bin/bash
PYENV_SHELL=bash
```

```bash
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "The command was not successful.";
    #do the needful / exit
fi;
```

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Hello World!")
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::printf("Hello World!\n");
    std::cin.ignore();
    return 0;
}
```

$$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/n^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{6} $$

$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
